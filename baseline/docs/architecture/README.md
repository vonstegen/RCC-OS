# Architecture And ADR Index

This directory records current architecture, deferred direction, and decision
history. For the 2.0.0 Alpha runtime, begin with the
[Alpha runtime boundary](ALPHA_RUNTIME_BOUNDARY.md), then use the
[module map](MODULE_MAP.md) and [module ownership contract](MODULE-OWNERSHIP.md)
for the area being changed.

An ADR's **decision status** records what happened to the decision. Its
**Alpha applicability** records whether that decision governs the packaged
Alpha. These fields are independent: an accepted long-term decision can be
deferred or only partially applicable to Alpha.

Alpha applicability uses these values:

- **Applies**: governs shipped Alpha behavior or its required trust boundary.
- **Partial**: only the scope stated in the ADR index note applies to Alpha.
- **Deferred**: not required for Alpha; retained as accepted or proposed future
  direction.
- **Not applicable**: an alternative or historical runtime path that must not
  be used for Alpha.
- **Development only**: governs repository work, not the shipped runtime.

## Current Alpha Architecture

The only required runtime path is:

```text
Chrome Manifest V3 extension
  -> authenticated loopback Node.js bridge
  -> approved providers and local services
```

The unpacked extension and bridge are the Alpha package. ADR-037 remains the
accepted long-term browser-contained product target, but Alpha is not a custom
Chromium distribution.

### Out Of Scope

- Tauri shells and Rust/Cargo build paths
- Electron shells and native CEF hosts
- terminal workspaces and Audio2TOL

## Authority Rules

- The Alpha boundary document wins for shipped components and privileged
  process flow.
- The module ownership contract wins for current source ownership.
- ADR bodies remain decision history. Their metadata and this index state how
  each decision applies now.
- Historical diagrams, audits, and research do not become current authority by
  linking to an accepted ADR.
